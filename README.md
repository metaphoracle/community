# Community Code of Conduct

We believe that a friendly environment is the best way to get better ideas, better discussions and, in the end, a better product. Let's make this easy for everybody in our community.


## Scope
We expect all members of the MetaphOracle community, including paid and unpaid agents, administrators, users, and customers of MetaphOracle, to abide by this Code of Conduct at all times in all MetaphOracle community venues, online and in person, and in one-on-one communications pertaining to MetaphOracle affairs.

This policy covers the usage of the MetaphOracle resources, as well as the MetaphOracle decentralized application, MetaphOracle related events, and any other services offered by or on behalf of MetaphOracle (collectively, the "Service"). It also applies to behavior in the context of the MetaphOracle Open Source project communities, including but not limited to public GitHub repositories, IRC channels, social media, mailing lists, and public events.

This Code of Conduct is in addition to, and does not in any way nullify or invalidate, any other terms or conditions related to use of the Service.


## Abusive behavior
Unacceptable behavior from any community member will not be tolerated. Anyone asked to stop unacceptable behavior is expected to comply immediately.

Abusive behavior may result on banning from the community.


## Copyright violations
We respect the intellectual property of others and ask that you do too. Please, make sure the code you contribute is yours. We won't accept code that violates a copyright. Please let us know if any code in our repositories is infringing any copyrights through opening an issue on the respective GitHub repository.


## Information and reports
If you feel like helping out, get more information or report any situation, please contact us using GitHub issues or Telegram (https://t.me/metaphoracle).

This Code of Conduct is based on the npm Code of Conduct.
